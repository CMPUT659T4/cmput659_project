\begin{abstract}
Diagnosis of schizophrenia is a challenging task that yet to be 
addressed\cite{McGuire200891}. Although, in recent years methods which use 
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) for mental disorder diagnosis has 
become more popular, but in case of schizophrenia it still needs to become 
more robust and reliable. In similar studies\cite{Rish_2013}\cite{Rosa_2013} 
have been shown that fMRI can be used in conjunction with Sparse Gaussian 
Markov Random Field (SGMRF) to produce high accuracy in diagnosis of illness. 
However having a dataset with homogeneous distribution of illness makes this 
result less reliable and creates the need for more evidence using 
heterogeneous dataset in terms of illness. In this work we pursue two path to 
tackle this problem. First, we evaluate performance of Sparse Gaussian Markov 
Random Field (SGMRF) on fMRI data obtained through whole brain, and second we 
work on Regions of Interest (ROI) according to Power et al.\cite{Power_2011}. 
We have used 5 fold cross validation for hyper parameter tuning and $20\%$ 
holdout set for test. Accuracies that we have obtained through mentioned 
method are: ------ for whole brain features and ---- for ROI features. While 
this result are slightly less than the results obtained by Rish \emph{et al.} 
it is on par with Rosa \emph{et al.} results.

\section{Introduction}
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a tool for recording 
functional changes caused by neuron activity. When a person is doing a task 
neuron activity fluctuate and human body in order to provide the energy 
needed for this activity increases the blood flow to feed the neurons with 
the needed glucose which is not stored in the brain. More blood flow also 
brings more oxygen through blood vessels. This change in the level of 
oxygenated blood know as oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin (oxygenated or 
deoxygenated blood) changes the magnetic susceptibility of blood (BOLD signal) 
which is the base for detection in MRI machine.  
Schizophrenia is mental disorder that has been shown to affect blood flow in patient's brain\cite{Kenji_2010}.
